# cabns.ts

### asyncMiddleware

This function is used as a middleware to handle asynchronous operations within the routes. It wraps the async functions to catch and handle errors that occur during the execution of the asynchronous code.

### String Helper

Utility functions from the `stringHelper` are used to provide string-related operations, likely for formatting or message generation.

### doValidationForCreateUserCabn

A validation function that checks the incoming request data to ensure it meets the requirements for creating a user CABN. This likely involves checking if required fields are present and correctly formatted.

### createUserCabn

This function creates a new CABN record for a user. It takes the validated request data, processes it, and saves it to the database or a related storage system.

### deleteUserIdFromCabn

This function removes a user ID from a specified CABN. It requires the CABN ID and user details to locate the CABN and update or delete the user ID from it.

### deleteUserIdFromAllCabns

This function removes a user ID from all CABNs where it is present. This might be necessary when a user is deleted from the system or removed from all associated CABNs.

### Router Configuration

The file configures three routes within a given router object:

1.  POST /create - Handles the creation of a new CABN. It first validates the request and then proceeds to create a CABN using the `createUserCabn` function.
2.  DELETE /all - Handles the deletion of a user ID from all CABNs, using the `deleteUserIdFromAllCabns` function.
3.  DELETE /:cabnId - Handles the deletion of a user ID from a specific CABN based on the CABN ID provided in the route parameters.

Each route uses `asyncMiddleware` to wrap the async handlers, ensuring that any exceptions are caught and handled properly.

The code effectively modularizes the handling of CABNs, allowing for clean and maintainable routes that focus on specific aspects of CABN management.

# transactions.ts

### 1\. POST `/do/swap/and/withdraw/:swapTxId`

This route handles the processing of a swap and withdrawal transaction. It first performs validations using the `swapTransactionHelper.validationForDoSwapAndWithdraw(req)` function. It then fetches the source and destination network details from the database based on provided network IDs in the query parameters. If either network is not found, it throws an error. The transaction is created and processed through helper functions in `swapTransactionHelper`, and the result is returned to the client.

### 2\. PUT `/regenerate/swap/and/withdraw/:txId`

This endpoint is designed to handle transaction regeneration for swap and withdrawal operations. It fetches the source network using the chain ID from the query parameters and validates the presence of the source network. It then retrieves the transaction receipt from the blockchain using the transaction ID (`req.params.txId`). Depending on the transaction's on-chain status, it either handles a successful transaction regeneration or a failed transaction using `swapTransactionHelper`, sends a Slack notification regarding the transaction status, and returns the result to the client.

### 3\. GET `/list`

This GET route lists all transactions associated with the user. It constructs a query filter based on the user's ID, and optional filters for source network, transaction hash, and swap or withdrawal transaction IDs. It counts the total documents that match the filter and fetches the transaction data accordingly, using pagination if specified. It returns the transactions and the total count.

### 4\. GET `/:txId`

This endpoint retrieves a specific transaction by its ID (`req.params.txId`). It constructs a filter with the transaction ID, fetches the transaction from the database, and populates related data from associated collections. It then returns the transaction data to the client.

Each of these routes uses a series of helper functions and middleware to process and handle transactions related to multi-swap functionalities in a blockchain context. This includes network validations, transaction receipt handling, and notifications through Slack for status updates.

# referrals.ts

#### POST /create/referral/code

**Description**: Creates a unique referral code for the user if it doesn't already exist.

**Request**:

- **Headers**: User authentication required (uses `req.user._id`).
- **Body**: None.

**Response**:

- **Success (200)**: Returns the referral code.
- **Failure (400)**: N/A.

**Implementation**:

1.  Generates a unique referral code using `generateUniqueReferralCode()`.
2.  Checks if the user already has a referral code using `getUserReferral(req.user._id)`.
3.  If the referral code exists, returns it.
4.  If the referral code does not exist, creates a new entry in the `db.Referrals` collection with the user's ID and the generated code.
5.  Returns the newly created referral code.

#### GET /referral/code

**Description**: Retrieves the referral code for the authenticated user.

**Request**:

- **Headers**: User authentication required (uses `req.user._id`).
- **Body**: None.

**Response**:

- **Success (200)**: Returns the referral code.
- **Failure (400)**: Returns an error message if the referral code does not exist.

**Implementation**:

1.  Retrieves the referral code for the user using `getUserReferral(req.user._id)`.
2.  If the referral code exists, returns it.
3.  If the referral code does not exist, returns a 400 error with a message indicating the referral code does not exist.

### Functions

#### generateUniqueReferralCode

**Description**: Generates a unique referral code. Imported from `referralHelper`.

#### getUserReferral

**Description**: Retrieves referral information for a specific user. Imported from `referralHelper`.

### Dependencies

- **multiSwapHelpers/referralHelper**: Helper functions for referral code generation and retrieval.
- **db.Referrals**: Database model for referral information.
