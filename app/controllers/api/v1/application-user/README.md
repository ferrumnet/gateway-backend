# addresses.ts

1.  Unique Address Check (`GET /is/unique`)

    - Purpose: Verifies if an address is unique within the specified Ferrum network.
    - Parameters:
      - `address`: The address to check.
      - `ferrumNetworkIdentifier`: Identifier for the Ferrum network.
    - Responses:
      - `200`: Returns whether the address is unique (`true` or `false`).
      - `400`: Bad request when required parameters are missing or the network identifier is invalid.

2.  Unique and Authenticated Address Check (`GET /is/unique/and/authenticated`)

    - Purpose: Checks if an address is both unique and authenticated within the specified network.
    - Parameters: Same as the unique address check.
    - Responses:
      - `200`: Returns whether the address is unique and authenticated.
      - `400`: Bad request for missing parameters or invalid network identifier.

3.  Authenticated Address Check (`GET /is/authenticated`)

    - Purpose: Determines if an address is authenticated.
    - Parameters:
      - `address`: The address to check.
      - `ferrumNetworkIdentifier`: The network identifier.
      - `userId`: User identifier to validate authentication.
    - Responses:
      - `200`: Whether the address is authenticated.
      - `400`: Bad request for missing parameters or issues with the network identifier.

4.  Generate Nonce for Address (`POST /generate/nonce`)

    - Purpose: Generates a nonce for an address in a network, facilitating further operations like signing.
    - Parameters:
      - `address`: The address to generate nonce for.
      - `ferrumNetworkIdentifier`: Network identifier.
    - Responses:
      - `200`: Returns the generated nonce.
      - `400`: Bad request if parameters are missing or if the address cannot be found in the network.

5.  Verify Signature (`POST /verify-signature`)

    - Purpose: Verifies the signature of an address to authenticate it.
    - Parameters:
      - `signature`: The signature to verify.
      - `address`: The address associated with the signature.
      - `ferrumNetworkIdentifier`: Network identifier.
      - `role`: The role associated with the signature.
    - Responses:
      - `200`: Success if the signature is verified and related user actions are successful.
      - `400`: Bad request on failure to verify the signature or issues with parameters.

6.  Connect to Address (`POST /connect/to/address`)

    - Purpose: Connects a user to an address within the Ferrum network, possibly for administrative purposes.
    - Parameters:
      - `address`: Address to connect.
      - `ferrumNetworkIdentifier`: Network identifier.
      - `role`: User role.
    - Responses:
      - `200`: Successfully connected and potentially creates a new user.
      - `400`: Bad request for missing parameters, failed user creation, or connection issues.

### Usage

Each function is attached to the `router` object and is designed to handle specific API requests. They leverage `async/await` for asynchronous operations, primarily interacting with databases and helper functions for address management. These endpoints ensure robust handling of errors and validations, providing clear feedback for missing or incorrect inputs.

# tokens.ts

#### `router.get('/')`

- Purpose: Fetches a token for an application user based on the provided API key.
- Parameters:
  - `req`: The HTTP request object. It expects an `apikey` in the request headers.
  - `res`: The HTTP response object used to send back the HTTP response.
- Process:
  1.  API Key Validation: Checks if the `apikey` is provided in the headers. If not, returns a 400 error with the message "apiKey in headers is required."
  2.  API Key Decryption: Attempts to decrypt the `apikey` using `commonFunctions.decryptApiKey`. If decryption fails, returns a 400 error with the message "apiKey is invalid."
  3.  User Lookup: Uses the decrypted API key to find a corresponding user in the database.
  4.  Token Generation and Response:
      - If a user is found, generates a token using `user.createAPIToken(user)` and returns it with a 200 status.
      - If no user matches the API key, returns a 400 error with a message indicating that the API key is invalid, fetched from a string helper function.
  5.  Error Handling: Catches any database or server errors and returns a 400 status with the error message.

### Comments

- Security Note: The function includes basic security checks for API key validity and decryption to ensure secure access to user tokens.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error responses ensure that the caller can understand why a request may have failed.
