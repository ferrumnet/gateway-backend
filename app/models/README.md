# gasFees.ts

- File Overview: This file defines a Mongoose model for gas fees associated with blockchain transactions. It is designed to interact with MongoDB to store and retrieve gas fee data.

- Variables:

  - `mongoose`: The Mongoose library imported to handle modeling and schema definition for MongoDB.
  - `collectionName`: A string representing the name of the MongoDB collection to store gas fee data.

- Schema Definition:

  - `schema`: A Mongoose Schema object that defines the structure of the gas fee data in the MongoDB database.
    - `maxFeePerGas`: The maximum fee per gas unit allowed for the transaction (as a string).
    - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: The maximum priority fee per gas unit to expedite the transaction (as a string).
    - `gasLimit`: The gas limit for the transaction (as a string).
    - `type`: Type of transaction or additional descriptor (as a string).
    - `chainId`: The blockchain network identifier this fee applies to (as a string).
    - `isActive`: A boolean flag indicating if the fee setting is currently active.

- Model Creation:

  - `gasFeesModel`: The Mongoose model created by binding the `schema` to the `collectionName`, enabling CRUD operations on documents within the "gasFees" collection.

# index.ts

1.  Dynamic Module Importing:

    - The script uses Node.js's `fs` module to read all files in the current directory (`__dirname`).
    - It iterates over each file in the directory.

2.  Conditional Filtering:

    - The code excludes files named 'plugins' and 'index.js' from being processed. This is likely to prevent re-importing of plugins or the index file itself, avoiding potential circular dependencies or redundancy.

3.  Module Exporting:

    - For each file that passes the filter, the file name is transformed to construct a module name by removing its extension.
    - The first character of the module name is capitalized to adhere to a naming convention (possibly to match TypeScript or JavaScript class naming conventions).
    - The module is then required (imported) and exported dynamically. This allows other parts of the application to import these models conveniently using the constructed module names.
