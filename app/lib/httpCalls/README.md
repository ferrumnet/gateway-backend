# swapAndWithdrawTransactionsJob.ts

### `doWithdrawSigned(req, swapAndWithdrawTransactionObject, token)`

This asynchronous function handles the process of making a signed withdrawal request. It configures the authorization headers, determines the appropriate base URL based on the environment, and constructs the request URL using transaction details. The function then makes a POST request to the API endpoint and logs the transaction hash if the response contains data. In case of an error, it logs the error details.

- Parameters:

  - `req`: The request object (not fully detailed in the provided code).
  - `swapAndWithdrawTransactionObject`: Object containing details about the swap and withdrawal transaction.
  - `token`: Authorization token (usage not shown in the provided snippet).

- Returns: The body of the response if successful, or `null` in case of failure.

### `getTokenQuoteInformation(req)`

This asynchronous function fetches token quote information based on query parameters provided in the `req` object. It configures the authorization headers, determines the base URL, constructs the request URL with required query parameters, and makes a GET request to the API. It logs the response body if the data is received.

- Parameters:

  - `req`: The request object containing query parameters for source amount, network chain IDs, and token contract addresses.

- Returns: The body of the response if data is available, or `null` in case of an error.

### `getWithdrawBody(model)`

A helper function that constructs the body of a withdrawal request based on the provided model. It logs and returns the constructed body, which includes details such as source and destination amounts, network IDs, token contract addresses, wallet addresses, signatures, and other relevant transaction details.

- Parameters:

  - `model`: An object containing all necessary details for the withdrawal transaction.

- Returns: The constructed body object for the withdrawal request.

# slackAxiosHelper.ts

### Function: `postMultiswapAlertIntoChannel`

Description: This asynchronous function sends a multiswap alert to a specified Slack channel using a POST request.

Parameters:

- `body`: Any type. This parameter contains the payload to be sent to the Slack webhook.

Returns:

- This function returns the `data` field from the Axios response if the POST request is successful. If the request fails (caught by the try-catch block), it returns `null`.

Detailed Behavior:

1.  URL Retrieval: The function retrieves the webhook URL from a global environment variable, specifically `global.environment.slackMultiswapAlertNotificationUrl`.
2.  Axios Configuration: It sets up the Axios configuration, particularly the `headers` where the `Authorization` header is initially set as an empty string.
3.  POST Request: Executes a POST request using Axios with the `url`, `body`, and `config` as parameters.
4.  Error Handling: If an error occurs during the request (e.g., network issues, invalid URL), the error is logged to the console and the function returns `null`.
5.  Successful Response: If no error occurs, the response data from the POST request is returned.

This function is designed to integrate with Slack APIs by utilizing a webhook URL provided in the global environment configuration, allowing for seamless alerts about multiswap events directly to a configured Slack channel.
